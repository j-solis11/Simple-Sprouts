Overview

Simple Sprouts is an autonomous vertical farming system built around a custom-designed PCB, a Raspberry Pi 5 controller, and integrated environmental sensing and actuation. The system uses sensor feedback to manage irrigation, lighting, and temperature across a two-level enclosure. All design files, CAD models, schematics, and supporting documentation are included in the GitHub repository to allow future teams full access for reproduction or improvement.

This document serves as the complete hardware report, detailing schematics, PCB/CAD designs, Bill of Materials (BOM), datasheet references, power specifications, and physical system documentation.

4. Power Requirements

Primary Power Source:

24V DC regulated supply rated at 3A (MeanWell GST60A24)

Voltage Rails:

24V Primary Input Rail

12V Step-down Rail (via DC-DC converter) for:

Water Pump

LED Grow Lights

Peltier Heating Module

5V Step-down Rail (via DC-DC converter) for:

Raspberry Pi 5

All environmental sensors

Typical System Power Load:

Raspberry Pi 5: ~1.5A @ 5V

Water Pump: ~0.8A @ 12V (peak)

This folder contains all of the CAD files we created to visualize our Simple Sprouts
project. Please note that these files are very outdated and were never kept up to date
because we felt that this was beyond our scope for the project and what we wanted to achieve.
We only wanted a simple frame that got the job done, we did not need to manufacture our own
custom parts with tolerances. Therefore, this folder serves as a visualization of the early stages
of Simple Sprouts, highlighting why we chose to go the way we did.
